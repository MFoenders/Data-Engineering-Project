## Building a Data Pipeline for 'Gans'

Welcome to the GitHub page for my project! 🌟 This is about a data pipeline I built, which I talked about in my Medium article, "Unlocking Data Gold: A Practical Guide to Building a Data Pipeline." 📝 This work was part of what I learned at the WBS Coding School’s Data Science Bootcamp. The project is about making a data pipeline for a made-up e-scooter company called 'Gans.' 🛴
